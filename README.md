SLIDING WINDOW PATTERN :

ðŸ“˜ Phase 1: Easy â€“ Build the Basics (Fixed-size)

#	Problem	LeetCode #	Goal
(1-643)	
(-1343)
(3-438)
(4-567)
(5-1876)	

âœ… Goal: Understand window size, sliding logic, and character frequency.

ðŸ“— Phase 2: Medium â€“ Variable Window & Conditions

#	Problem	LeetCode #	Goal
6	Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters	3	Most famous variable-size window
7	Minimum Size Subarray Sum	209	Shrink window based on sum
8	Fruits into Baskets	904	Max length with at most 2 distinct types
9	Longest Repeating Character Replacement	424	Keep window valid by replacing chars
10	Count Number of Nice Subarrays	1248	Use prefix sums + window style
11	Max Consecutive Ones III	1004	Replace 0s to get max 1s
12	Subarray Product Less Than K	713	Multiply elements in sliding window
13	Count Binary Substrings	696	Basic but good for practice

âœ… Goal: Learn how to expand and shrink the window while tracking constraints.

ðŸ“™ Phase 3: Advanced â€“ Smart Tricks & Deque

#	Problem	LeetCode #	Goal
14	Sliding Window Maximum	239	Use deque to track max in O(n)
15	Minimum Window Substring	76	Hard, classic â€“ match chars using freq map
16	Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters	340	Generic version of other substring problems
17	Longest Continuous Subarray with Absolute Diff â‰¤ Limit	1438	Use TreeMap or Monotonic Queue
18	Max Points You Can Obtain from Cards	1423	Reverse sliding window logic
19	Count Number of Substrings with Exactly K Distinct Characters	992	Subtle double sliding window trick
20	Binary Subarrays With Sum	930	Count subarrays with exact sum using hash map
